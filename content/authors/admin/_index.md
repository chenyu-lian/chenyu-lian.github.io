I'm a Master's student majoring in Computer Science and Technology in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Xiamen University.

Before this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in engineering from Xiamen University in 2021.

My research interests primarily revolve around medical image analysis, with a specific focus on multi-modal representation learning.
